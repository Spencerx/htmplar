# Templar

Templar is a React to HTML converter. It is created for developer friendly e-mail template development. By leveraging
the component structure with React, it composes a reusable and maintainable pipeline for the projects.

Benefits:

- Allow themable components with the help of React-JSS & Styled Components.
- Easy of use, instead of dealing with huge table based layouts, you are only dealing with small/simple React
  components.
- Automatic HTML conversion and e-mail friendly CSS creation.

## Use cases

The use case of this library is to create e-mail templates to improve the development process.

adidas is not responsible for the usage of this software for different purposes that the ones described in the use
cases.

## Requirements and dependencies

You need [NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/) to install and run the tool.

## Installation

"develop": "htmplar dev"
}
```

All set, you can start to develop your emails by running `npm run develop` or `yarn run develop`
